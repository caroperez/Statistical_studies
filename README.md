Personal data analysis projects in Python and R

In this repository, you will find a series of personal projects to analyze different databases. 

I have tried to analyze different types of databases, which you will find in the folder databeses/. Most of these databases are available at kaggle.com. I will now describe and list the current projects and their development phase.
